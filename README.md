Welcome to MyToken!
Hey there! Welcome to the MyToken project. It's a pleasure to have you here. MyToken is a special Ethereum-based token contract that allows you to mint new tokens and burn existing ones.

What's MyToken All About?
MyToken is a simple yet powerful ERC20 token contract written in Solidity. It's designed to give you control over creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Whether you're looking to start your own digital currency or experiment with tokenomics, MyToken has got you covered.

Getting Started
Getting started with MyToken is a breeze! Here's how you can dive in:

Remix IDE: Head over to Remix IDE, a fantastic online Ethereum development environment. You can access it here.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyToken{
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    
    mapping(address=> uint256)public balances;

    event Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value);

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _totalSupply) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        totalSupply = _totalSupply;

    }

    function mint(address _to, uint256 _value) public{
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Mint(_to, _value);

    }

    function burn(address _from, uint256 _value)public {
        require(balances[_from] >= _value, "insufficient balance");
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        emit Burn(_from, _value);
    }
}

Compile the contract using the appropriate Solidity compiler version. Then, deploy the contract by selecting MyToken from the dropdown menu. Don't forget to provide the required constructor parameters: token name, symbol, and total supply.

Interact: Once the contract is deployed, you're all set to interact with it! You can mint new tokens using the mint function and burn existing tokens using the burn function.

Functions at Your Fingertips
Let's break down what you can do with MyToken:

Minting: With the mint function, you can create new tokens and assign them to any address you choose.

Burning: Use the burn function to destroy existing tokens from a specific address. It's a handy way to manage token supply.

Events to Keep You Updated
MyToken keeps you in the loop with two essential events:

Mint Event: Whenever new tokens are minted, the Mint event is emitted. It lets you know where the tokens went and how many were created.

Burn Event: When tokens are burned, the Burn event fires off. It helps you track token destruction and maintain transparency.
